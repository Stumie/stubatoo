# StuBaToo - Stumie's Bash Toolbox
This repository is a toolbox of Bash scripts, that often rely on each other.\
Its use case is to suit my own needs best. But since most of my needs are probably also someone else's needs, I decided to share my toolbox via GitHub under GPL-3.0 license.
> [!WARNING]
> 1. The scripts were only manually tested and only on Debian stable- and unstable-based distributions. So, you might encounter unknown issues with other distributions or even other Debian release versions.
> 2. I'm not a real programmer myself, so be cautious, that my scripts might not follow otherwise vastly established programming principles.
## Scripts
### current-cpu-frequency.sh
Little helper script to show live CPU frequencies over all cores, without installing any bigger tool for that use case.
### get-new-kerberos-ticket.sh
When I sometimes need a new kerberos token, where I almost always forget a step. This little helper stands by.
### install-outlook-on-edge.sh
Creates a nice `*.desktop` file for Microsoft Outlook Web.

> [!WARNING]
> Needs Microsoft Edge installed and openable via `microsoft-edge`. _(So e. g. probably not working with MS Edge installed via Flatpak.)_

> [!TIP]
> `install-outlook-on-edge.sh` is not relying on other sub-scripts and therefore could be easily forked or used independently.
### netstat-without-netstat.sh
based on [qistoph/awk_netstat.sh](https://gist.github.com/qistoph/1b0708c888f078c3720de6c6f9562997)
### nslookup-multi.sh
Little helper script to find out, if a DNS change already synchronized to some of the major DNS service providers.
### pull-all-git-repos-in-workspace.sh
I usually clone my git repos to `$HOME\workspace`. 
This little helper script pullsall repos in that workspace directory.
### wine-prefix-installer.sh
#### Introduction
This is the probably biggest and most complex script in my toolbox. The script's goal is to help installing Windows software under Linux via Wine, like e. g. also [Lutris](https://lutris.net/) or [PlayOnLinux](https://www.playonlinux.com/) do. Main differences of this script are the higher focus on automation and the absence of a GUI _(and of course, that my script is much simpler since it's only an one-person-hobby-project)_.\
It all started with my efforts in bringing O365 to Linux: Therefore, this script's ancestor is my other GitHub repo [Stumie/wine-prefix_O365](https://github.com/Stumie/wine-prefix_O365), which now is in 'Public archive' state.
#### Known flaws
Before use, be aware of some known flaws:
* The script does have minor error handling. It shouldn't break your system, but still, be cautious and check console output carefully! _(...although wine tends to be very verbose...)_
* The script currently only has dependency installation routines for Debian-based distributions, mainly because of included apt-get commands and apt source installations.
* The script currently automatically installs the most current [WineHQ](https://www.winehq.org/) release of the chosen release branch _(except for the `bottles` variant)_, directly from the WineHQ repositories. Although I'm able to test some releases, I cannot guarantee for functionality of all or even future versions.
* The script, and especially its `wine-prefix-orders`, include some hardcoded URLs or other clauses, which might get outdated or break in the future. No guarantee for function here.
* If you choose `bottles` as your installation target, in the current state Mono and Gecko are not installed by default: That means, that some `wine-prefix-orders`, that do work with the WineHQ variant, might not work with Bottles as installation target _(at least not out of the box)_.
* ...and probably many more flaws...
### wine-prefix-remover.sh
With this handy little script you can remove wine prefixes and bottles comfortable, that you formerly created with the help of `wine-prefix-installer.sh`.
